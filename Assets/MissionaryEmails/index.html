    <b>Where have I been?</b>
    <br>
    I have been in Denver, of course. 
    <br>
    It's been a while since I have written a letter, I would like to say I have been busy, but there is really no excuse I can make for not writing to you all for so long. I can't promise that I will be more consistent but I hope that you all will enjoy this letter.
    <br>
    <b>The Work</b>
    <br>
    The work has been awesome here, a lot has happened in these past couple of months, I got a new companion, Elder Thiriot, I became a district leader, and Javier got baptized! I have been in the same area of Denver still in the Sloan Lake Ward, and it has been a ton of fun.
    <br>    
    <b>The Conversion of Javier</b>
    <br>    
    As I mentioned in my last letter(a long time ago), our friend Javier accepted a date for the 26th of November, that date was pushed back a bit and he ended up getting baptized on the 17th of December. It was awesome seeing him progress and gain a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, one thing that really stuck with him was how the Book of Mormon talked about America being the promise land. He is from Mexico, and he came over here to visit for a few months and he had really enjoyed his time here in America. He actually recognizes the opportunity here in America, and why the Church of Jesus Christ was able to be restored here because of religious freedom. He loves this place and he says he wants to come back after he returns to Mexico. He had a couple chances to bear testimony of that and also of his baptism to one of our friends Alex Meza. Speaking of his baptism, it was awesome! We had his baptism combined with another person and it was really Spirit filled, he actually came a full hour early because he didn't want to be late, his commitment to the church is astounding. He was going to move away in March, but more recently he told us he may be going back sooner because of the price of plane tickets, but he said he really wants to come back and live here. I'm super grateful for the opportunity to get to have known Javier and teach him the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
    <br>    
    <b>Being a District Leader</b>
    <br>    
    A while ago President Blake assigned me to be a district leader over the Zuni District in Denver. It has been an awesome experience being a district leader. As a district leader you get to work with missionaries more closely, conduct missionary exchanges, lead district councils, and account with other missionaries. While I've been a district leader I've been able to learn from other missionaries and see their faith, I've learned a lot and I've strived to be a better missionary and example for the members in my district and it has been a great growing experience for me.
    <br>    
    <b>Things Recently</b>
    <br>    
    Everything has been good recently, we were on bike but got a car a couple weeks ago(which I am super thankful for), we moved apartments to a more central point in our area. We have been finding a lot of families to teach, and our friend Alex Meza is getting baptized this Saturday the 21st! Alex is our friend who we found a while ago, he has come to church every sunday ever since we found him. He is so dedicated to the Gospel, the first time we met him we told him we would get him a ride to church, but sunday morning came and it was too late, we forgot to get him a ride. 30 minutes before the Sacrament Meeting, I sent him a bus route he could take, I didn't think he was going to show up(I really didn't), but to my surprise he did! We have truly seen his dedication since day one, and we are excited for him to get baptized! 
    <br>    
    <b>Things On My Mind</b>
    <br>
    One of things I think is really important to understand is that Jesus Christ knows us and understands who we are. Jesus Christ is our Savior, our Redeemer, our Perfect Example, our Brother, our Father, and sometimes we forget but He is our Friend, the Perfect Friend.
    <br>
    I think we ought to remember that Jesus walks with us always, through all of our troubles, trials, and tribulations, through everything, He is there. Yesterday we were giving a church tour to a man named Jose, while we were talking with him, another set of missionaries was also giving a church tour to their friend, and while we were walking to the chapel, I overheard one of those other Elders, Elder Blair, he was telling their friend about the painting of Jesus knocking on the door, he asked their friend "do you notice something weird about this door?" That's really all I heard Elder Blair say, by the time their friend answered we were all the way down the hall near the chapel. But I was left to think about that question, I thought about it, imagined that picture that I have seen many times and realized for the first time that in that painting there is no handle on the door. I had a chance to ponder about what that means, there is a scripture related to that painting in Revelations 3:20 that says "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." What this means to me is that Jesus is standing at our door always, sometimes knocking, but he won't come in, unless we open the door ourselves. Sometimes people knock at our door, and we don't hear it, sometimes Jesus knocks at our door and we don't recognize or hear it. Sometimes people knock at our door and hear but choose to ignore it(like people do to missionaries all the time), Jesus knocks at our door, sometimes we don't want to answer it because of the pride in our hearts. Sometimes Jesus doesn't knock, but he stays beside your door. Point is, we can let Jesus into our lives, if we are willing to do what it takes. He is always there standing beside you waiting for you to open that door and let Him in. I have seen that in my mission, and I have chosen to open that door and sometimes keep it closed, I have seen and felt the joy that comes from opening that door and the despair that comes from choosing to keep the door closed.
    <br>
    I love the song 'I Know that My Savior Loves Me' which reminds me of his accepting and everlasting love he has for us.
    <br>
    <b>I Know that My Savior Loves Me</b>
    <br>
    A long time ago in a beautiful place,
    <br>
    Children were gathered ’round Jesus.
    <br>
    He blessed and taught as they felt of His love.
    <br>
    Each saw the tears on His face.
    <br>
    The love that He felt for His little ones
    <br>
    I know He feels for me.
    <br>
    I did not touch Him or sit on His knee,
    <br>
    Yet, Jesus is real to me.
    <br>
    Now I am here in a beautiful place,
    <br>
    Learning the teachings of Jesus.
    <br>
    Parents and teachers will help guide the way,
    <br>
    Lighting my path ev’ry day.
    <br>
    Wrapped in the arms of my Savior’s love,
    <br>
    I feel His gentle touch.
    <br>
    Living each day, I will follow His way,
    <br>
    Home to my Father above.
    <br>
    Love,
    <br>

    <b>Why?</b>
    <br>
    Today I am sending my weekly(sorta weekly) email in the format of a document. I've been experimenting with different ways to share my missionary experience rather than the standard email. Sometimes things get too repetitive and boring for me, sometimes I feel like I write emails that only a few people read. So I've resorted to different ways to communicate my mission experience to be more creative. I hope all of you who read these emails will appreciate them and find at least a little value from them.
    <br>
    <b>The Work</b>
    <br>
    The work here is good, hard sometimes but fulfilling and awesome, especially here in Denver. In the Boulder Zone missionary work was harder, especially when most of the population is not latinos, we worked mostly in areas like trailer parks, you couldn't really walk around and see latinos in Boulder. We came so close to baptizing someone in that branch, but just as we thought things were speeding up, something would happen and cramp our progress. The branch was tough because of the lack of members, the branch would baptize people, but the retention was very low, in order for a recent convert to stay they would have needed to have a very strong testimony in the gospel. Gives me an interesting perspective on the early state of the church and how hard it must have been to grow small branches in different parts of the world at first. Me and Elder Jimenez were also assigned to the Louisville Ward as well, however assigned to a smaller more rural part of the ward, which made it very difficult to find people to teach. As you may recall we did teach John and Shelly Couch, they were awesome referrals, but at some point they had concerns about baptism and stopped talking with us. However, recently John and Shelly reached back out to the missionaries serving there now and are being taught again. Boulder was tough, but nevertheless it was a fun place to serve. I made a lot of great friends there. P-Days(Preparation Days) were awesome going to the mountains, but the work felt slow there.
    <br>
    Over here in Denver things are much different, there are apartment complexes full of latinos to teach, a ton of mexican marts, and a ton of people willing to listen. In Boulder we had trouble finding people to teach, over we are having trouble finding people that will keep the invitations we extend. The ward here is also a bit interesting, many Spanish members here decide to go to the Sloans Lake Ward, an English ward, rather than the Spanish Monaco Ward. Apparently there was some drama that happened in that ward and now some of the Spanish people prefer to come to this ward instead. Because of this and the ward we are in is super diverse. There are a ton of people from all over the place in this ward, and a good mix of old and young people. It's really hard to keep track of them all because all the married couples like going by different last names. This is also my first time being in a bike area, it's pretty hard sometimes but it allows us to talk with a lot more people and get good exercise. Overall though I enjoy this area, challenges have arised, but we have learned to overcome them.
    <br>
    <b>Past Week In Denver</b>
    <br>
    This past week has actually been pretty eventful, on Thursday we taught a man named Javier, after our English class we gave a short message about the gospel. After our message, Javier approached us and asked about church, we asked if he wanted to hear a message about our church in our chapel, he agreed and we taught the message of the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ. The spirit was so strong, we helped him recognize the spirit, we gave him a Book of Mormon and invited him to read, pray, and ponder about our visit together. That next day we had another lesson with him, we read the Book of Mormon and prayed, he received a witness of the Book of Mormon there and we talked about our purpose to baptize others into the true Church of Christ. He was so excited to accept our invitation to be baptized on the 26th of November, we are going to have to push back the date a little bit, because of things that came up, but that's no problem. He came to church and for Sunday school we taught the Plan of Salvation and our members basically taught lessons perfectly for us. 
    <br>
    On Saturday me and my District Leader, Elder Finance, went on a super cool exchange. We had several awesome miracles that night, and I want to mention at least one. At about eight we had one hour left to work, we had nothing planned so we looked through our Areabook looking for people who had previously been taught, we decided to go to this one women's apartment that wasn't too far from where we were at the time. Her apartment number was 56, we searched around and couldn't find it, we asked some people and then didn't know. Eventually some people came walking by and we ask them, and they told us that no one lives there, and that they had actually lived there a little while, but they were moved into a different apartment. So we told them we had a message prepared for that person we were looking for, and asked them if they would like to hear it, they said yes, we taught a family that night about the Church of Jesus Christ and how our families can find happiness through the gospel. Insane, what are the chances that we meet people who used to live in that same apartment we were looking for, we recognized it as a miracle and so did they.
    <br>
    <b>Things On My Mind</b>
    The Tree of Life. I love this painting by Greg Olson because it represents the world we live in today. The Tree of Life represents the presence of God and the happiness we can obtain, the iron rod represents the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and His Commandments. The darkness around the iron rod representing the veil and having to walk by faith, and the great and spacious building, the temptations of this world, the disguising of wickedness to seem like happiness. So many things in this world are competing for our attention, but what really matters? If God really is real(which He is), then He must be the most important thing we need to focus on. I feel like sometimes we separate God and our daily life, but really in reality they go hand in hand, we should involve God in every aspect of our lives, every second, not just on the Sabbath. What I love about this painting is the way it shows that the great and spacious building is impossible to reach, there is literally an uncrossable abyss, no matter how joyful, how fun you think the great and spacious building looks, you will always die trying to obtain that 'happiness' it falsely advertises. People are killing themselves spiritually and many times literally trying to obtain an everlasting joy through immortality, drugs, money. You will never find an everlasting joy through temporal things. We must involve God in our lives, our careers, our families, our problems. Search for ways to do the things Prophets and Apostles have encouraged us to do. Find joy in sharing the Gospel. There is literally no other conversation that you can have that is more meaningful and important than the conversation you have with your Heavenly Father every night. Recognize the importance of following God and make that your highest priority. Sometimes we will be walking in the dark, although if we hold on we are promised to partake of an everlasting life. Nothing beats that, literally nothing. When I am tempted to think otherwise I like to remember the words found in Hymn 85, "How Firm a Foundation"
    <br>
    God's Part
    <br>
    "Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,
    <br>
    For I am thy God and will still give thee aid."
    <br>
    …
    <br>
    Our Part
    <br>
    "I’ll never, no never, I’ll never, no never,
    <br>
    I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!"
    <br>
    God is real, Jesus Christ is real. Remember that always.
    <br>
    Love,

    <h1>10/8/2022</h1>
    Hey everyone!
    <br>  
    I hope everyone is having a good week! This will be a quick email, but just wanted to update everyone on my mission real quick. Everything has been going awesome and we just had transfers, I got transferred to the Denver zone! I was super excited when I got the news, I've always wanted to serve in the city and its suburbs ever since I got the call to Denver. It's been super exciting here, we are on bike for now so I'm getting absolutely ripped 💪 Theres a lot of crazy people, and a couple nights ago we got chased by a wild dog on the road. People here are super humble and we are super excited to teach them all.
    <br>  
    Love yall and feel free to reach out to me!
    <br>  
    Love,
    <br>  
    Elder Burnside
    <h1>9/12/2022</h1>
    Hola todos!
    <br>  
    I. APOLOGY 
    <br>  
    It has been a real long time since I haven't written an email and I apologize for that, I know and understand that there are people, even if I forget or don't think so sometimes, that are waiting for these emails and enjoy reading them every week. So I will try my best to be more consistent in my emails from now on, sometimes its hard to remember or find the time to write this email, but I promise I'm trying.😅
    <br>  
    II. TRANSFERS
    <br>  
    Transfers had happened a few weeks ago, me and Elder Jimenez are staying in the Boulder area, although we got a few new people in our zone. We got a new zone leader, Elder Jarman, he's super awesome and he just returned to the mission. He's a super inspiring hard working guy who knows and wants to get stuff done. We got an Elder whose new to the mission, his name is Elder Tanner. I got the chance to go on a short exchange with him, we got to know each other and visited some people. He's super awesome and will make a great missionary.
    <br>  
    III. SPANISH
    <br>  
    My Spanish is a lot better, it's still pretty difficult to understand people sometimes but I'm definitely getting the hang of it now. The Latino people are so awesome over here and I love talking with them. It has taken awhile but the hardwork has paid off and its awesome speaking Spanish.
    <br>  
    IV. Zone Confrence 
    <br>  
    We had a killer Zone Confrence this last week, we focused on Preach My Gospel Chapter 10, which is a chapter that focuses on teaching and improving our teaching skills, there was a ton of insight there and President Blake as always was super inspiring.
    <br>  
    V. This Week
    <br>  
    This week was super cool, I went on an exchange with Elder Jarman one of our zone leaders and that was super cool. Learned a lot from him and had a ton of fun. We went to this members house to say hi and her mother comes out and says we need to go visit this random house half way across the trailer park. So we went with her and she literally talked to everyone we saw if they said hi back and introduced us as the missionaries. She's so dope. We ended teaching this dude and having a good lesson with him.
    <br>  
    That's pretty much it, lots has happened these past 6 weeks and its gone by super fast, it's been awesome serving the Lord and seeing him in our work! To bring people the truth is a tough task but it needs to be done. Christ is there for every single one of you.
    Love,
    <br>  
    Elder Burnside
    <h1>8/1/2022</h1>
    "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."(Genesis 1:1)
    <br>  
    God's power is incomprehensible, never ever put limits on what God can do.
    <br>  
    Because Moses didn't place limits on the Lord, he parted the red sea.
    <br>  
    Because the blind man didn't place limits on the Lord, he was healed of his blindness.
    <br>  
    And because Joesph Smith didn't place limits on the Lord, he found and translated an ancient record in only 65 days now known as The Book of Mormon.
    <br>  
    This week we saw an extremely small sliver of his power in our work, yet I'm still shocked what we saw this week. On thursday I had the chance to go on a exchange with one of my Zone Leaders, Elder Williams. Williams is such an awesome missionary and he taught me a lot that day. On that day we went to a park to plan, while we were talking, a kid randomly came up to us and said, "hey I think I have seen you guys!" We said he probably has seen missionaries like us before. He told us that he "needs us" and that "he saw Jesus's name on our tag." We told him that we would love to teach him and his family about Jesus, we told him to go get his mom, unfortunately we think that his mom told him no and left the park with him. However later that day we were searching for a house to teach someone who had been previously taught, however we couldn't find the house, the number was just missing, so we just ended up walking around the block, and while doing so four kids stopped and asked what we were doing. We told them we are Representatives of Jesus Christ, and that we teach and serve people like he did while he was on the Earth. They asked if we could teach them, and of course we said yes! We taught them The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, they loved it, and we asked them when we could come back and share more with them and their parents, they said come back satruday. We came back on satruday and taught four more people about the Restoration, we talked about The Book of Mormon and the kids were practically begging us to give them as many Books that we had, so we gave them all we had in the car which was four. A lot of people see us, and know that there is something different about us, I know there is people who have promptings to talk with us, but they don't act on those promptings because of fear. What I love about these kids is that they had that same prompting, but because they are kids they aren't as afraid and so they do approach us and ask us what we are doing, its so awesome to know that we are the light in their lives and that we are the ones that are bringing them and their family the truth.
    <br>  
    That same day I got a text from a man from Dubai, he wanted to talk with me and get to know me, eventually I told him that I was a missionary and that I share messages, we got to share the Restoration with him as well and it was so awesome to hear him so excited to read The Book of Mormon, we are going to work with the ward in Dubai to get him baptized, because we don't think there is missionaries over there at the moment.
    <br>  
    On that same Thursday, we visited a referral from a member, we were able to teach four people in that house and share the Restoration, I definitely felt like I had the gift of tounges there since Elder Williams didn't speak any Spanish.
    <br>  
    On Friday we had an amazing Zone Confrence where our Mission President talked a lot about faith and how we can get to a point where every companionship is baptizing every month. President Blake is a truly inspired man, he is loving and caring in every single way and truly cares about the people here in Colorado.
    <br>  
    Yesterday on Saturday we were deciding what to do when one of the Sister Companionships texted us and told us that there was a lot of Latinos at the park they were at, so we pulled up and talked to a couple at the park, we taught the Restoration gave them a Book of Mormon and got their phone number. They live in Lakewood outside of our mission so we will have to pass them off to the missionaries but we were grateful for that experience at the park.¹⁰^¹⁶
    <br>  
    On sunday right before church we got a call from a member in Utah, she told us of a friend she has in Colorado and she wanted us to find him friends and visit him. He was a man in his 50s and he was handicap. It was so awesome getting to meet him and his wife Shelly. It was a super cool experience teaching him about The Plan of Salvation with one of our members, Brother Goolsby.¹⁷ We are going back on Wednesday to teach him the Restoration and we are super excited. 
    <br>  
    Finally we met up with Edison, he was a person who self referred himself on the church website, he was super receptive the message of the Restoration and had a lot of questions.
    <br>  
    We found 18 new people to teach, in the past six weeks before this week we had only found eight new people those six weeks. What I found most profound about this, is that 16 of those people were referred or approached us at first. I've been praying that people may recognize us as true servants of Christ every day for the past few months and this week as I dedicated myself to Christ in my thoughts and actions, I have seen that people have recognized us as servants of Christ. I have truly seen that the power of God IS truly limitless.
    <br>  
    ESSAY: The INFINITE Power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ(Alma 36:18)
    <br>  
    We know that Alma the Younger was a great prophet, he is an incredible example of a Christ-like figure, he was such a righteousness man that the people are the Ancient Americas knew "nothing concerning his death and burial" and they suppose "that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord even as Moses."(Alma 45:19)
    <br>  
    However we also know that before his ministry he was one of the most vile sinners in the time of The Book of Mormon, he is described as "a wicked and an idolatrous man."(Mosiah 27:8) Alma himself says "that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror." 
    <br>  
    His father, Alma, and his family, despite his wickedness, prayed continually for him that the Lord would intervene and save him. Eventually an Angel of the Lord appeared unto him saying "the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people... Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth."(Mosiah 27:11) Alma then describes of how he fell to the ground and could not speak or move for three days, he explains of how he was "racked with eternal torment," he remembered all of his sins and was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all [his] sins."(Alma 36:12) However as his family fasted and prayed for him, and as Alma himself had a desire to be redeemed, he remembers the words of his father, about Jesus Christ. His account and experience of the redeeming power of the Atonement of Christ is written in Alma Chapter 36, verses 17-21:
    <br>  
    17 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.
    <br>  
    18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.
    <br>  
    19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.
    <br>  
    20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!
    <br>  
    21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.
    <br>  
    We can truly through the power of Christ, be clean, from everything. As we seek repentance with true faith and a willingness to do all the Lord asks of us, we too can feel as Alma, we can receive our strength again and be "born of God."(Alma 36:23)
    <br>  
    "In faith we’ll rely on the arm of Jehova."(Hymm 3)

    Hola!
    <br>  
    I haven't written for a while, because sometimes I feel like not much happens every week, but looking back there is actually a lot thats happened.
    <br>  
    First off we had transfers on the 14th, I'm staying here in Boulder but my companion Elder Rogers left to Aurora and I got a new companion, Elder Jimenez, he is super cool and has a lot of experience with the mission. We spent the first couple days introducing him to everyone in the branch. Along with a new companion we also got assigned to work in the Louisville Ward, so me and Elder Jimenez are covering the Spanish Branch and a bit of a English ward which is super exciting.
    <br>  
    This last week on Wednesday we had a long lesson with our friends Jesus and Linda, we taught about the Restoration with an emphasis on Priesthood Authority. We asked them to both be baptized Jesus accepted a date! As for Linda she told us she was baptized a long time ago in the year 2000 in Venezuela, we pulled her records and she's now a member of our branch! We are super excited!
    <br>  
    This past Saturday I was on an exchange with one of the Assistants to our Mission President, his name is Elder Packard and he's an awesome dude. At some point we were searching for someone missionaries had previously taught, his address wasn't specific enough and we could narrow it down to about four doors, so me and Elder Packard just decided to start knocking, the first door we knocked was someone named Jose, he wasn't the person we were looking for but we felt good about him so we asked him if we could share our message his said yes and we taught him the Restoration. Afterwards he said he wanted to come to church, so we called up a member on the spot and that member told him he would pick him up the next day! Such an awesome miracle and experience!
    <br>  
    Yesterday we really wanted to teach a guy named Manuel. For context we found Manuel six weeks ago street contacting, he was an awesome guy and he was free sundays so we taught him grabbed his phone number, unfortunately it ended up being super hard to get into contact with him and we gave up on contacting him. About two weeks ago, the sister missionaries were visiting somebody and they saw a man just standing outside his house, they couldn't speak to him because he spoke spanish so they got his address and sent it to us. It was Manuel! We had his address now so we could go try to find him. Unfortunately he wasn't home most of the time, but yesterday knowing it was his free day we went to his house knocked and no answer. I really felt like today was the day we were gonna get to teach him about Joesph Smith and the Book of Mormon so we decided to come back later, we got in the car and I started to just drive, it was about three minutes later we were on a busy street and I saw someone who looked familiar, I turned around got out the car and realized it was Manuel! We shared the Restoration and we are gonna teach him next week at church! Another amazinf miracle from the Lord.
    <br>  
    God is our Heavenly Father, he knows and loves us, every single one of us. He is aware of our situation and wants to guide us. My advice is too allow him to do so. Hearken unto our Prophets, the Scriptures, and personal prayer.

    Hola todo!
    <br>  
    This week was pretty chill, not much happened. We went out to a lot of events on the 4th of July and talked to a lot of people, there wasn't that many latinos celebrating but we made the best of it. We were taking a walk down some some streets in a trailer park, and we saw our friend Noel riding his bike doing a lap around the trailer park. He stopped to talk to us and he said he had some spaghetti for us, so we went to his house and he had some wet cold spaghetti with mayonnaise as the sauce and some mystery meat on the side, so that was super interesting. We went to Wendy's becuase our friend Juan works there and he's super cool, he gave us free frosties and all of his co workers were hyped to see us. It was a pretty great week though, my spanish is getting better and it's been awesome preaching the Gospel. As always its been hard but well worth it.

    Essay: The Title of Liberty(Alma 46:12)
    <br>  
    In Chapter 46 of The Book of Alma, a wicked man named Amalickiah conspires to be king over the Nephites, in verse 5 it describes that the Nephites were "led by the flatteries of Amalickiah." Verse 8 warns the reader and points out "how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one."
    <br>  
    Seeing this Captain Moroni realizes that the liberty of the Nephites was in danger, in response he took his coat and wrote "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children"(Verse 12) and fastened it upon a pole. He prayed mightly for his people unto God "that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored."(Verse 16) He then gathered the people together, and asked them to enter into a covenant to defend their religion and freedom.
    <br>  
    Captain Moroni is an incredible example of a man of Christ, he understood the importance of the liberty of the land and chose to courageously gather his people to fight against the insurrection of Amalickiah. He aligned his will with God's, gathered his people, and defended the liberty of his people. In Chapter 48 states if all men were alike unto Captain Moroni "the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men."(Verse 17)
    <br>  
    Liberty was a very important attribute to Captain Moroni, liberty allows us to choose for ourselves like God intended, becuase of this liberty should be an important attribute to us as well. Doctrine and Covenants Section 101 explains that the Lord "established" the constitution so "that every man may act... according to the moral agency which [he has given]."(Verse 77-78) Elder Dallin H. Oaks explains this further in his talk "Defending Our Divinely Inspired Constitution" saying, "The most desirable condition for the exercise of that agency is maximum freedom for men and women to act according to their individual choices." Later in the same talk, Elder Oaks echos Captain Moroni in saying "our belief in divine inspiration gives Latter-day Saints a unique responsibility to uphold and defend the United States Constitution and principles of constitutionalism wherever we live." We must stand as courageously as Captain Moroni did in defense of his God, his people, and his liberty.

    Hola Hermanos y Hermanas!!
    <br>  
    Its been a while since I've written my emails, I've been putting it off for a while, however I finally decided to write this week. 
    <br>  
    Its been pretty difficult over here these past few weeks, this zone is a whole lot different than Aurora especially having a branch instead of ward. The Spanish population here is a whole lot fewer than the population in Aurora, so finding has been a bit more difficult.
    <br>  
    In the branch we do have a lot of strong missionary minded members, the members are awesome and are always willing to help. Most of our recent converts are unfortunately inactive. We have a really funny recent convert named Noel, everytime we see him he goes, 'hola herrrrrrrrrrmanos." He's inactive because he works on sundays but he's always willing to meet with us. 
    <br>  
    Two sundays ago I gave my first ever talk in spanish about Father's Day, it was pretty bad but our members let me know that they understood the talk and that I did well.
    <br>  
    But thats pretty much it, its been hard teaching and finding, but we have found that as we rely more on the Lord that we will see the Gathering of Israel come forth in Colorado
    <br>  
    Essay: The Purpose of the Scriptures(Nephi 6:4)
    <br>  
    Nephi Chapter 6 is one of my favorite chapters in The Book of Mormon, its only six verses, but those six verses give the reader insight to why The Book of Mormon was written and of its importance.
    <br>  
    In the first three verses Nephi explains that he does not write of "the genealogy of my fathers... for it is given in the record which has been kept by my father." In verse three he explains that he desires that he "may write the things of God."
    <br>  
    In verse 4 Nephi writes "or the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham... and be saved." To parallel that, In the New Testament, the Apostle John writes these things "that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ... and that believing ye might have life through his name."(John 20:31) From these two exercpts we learn that purpose of the scriptures is to bring people unto salvation through our Savior, Jesus Christ.
    <br>  
    In verse 5 of 1st Nephi chapter 6, Nephi says that he does not write "the things which are pleasing unto the world" but he writes "the things which are pleasing unto God." We can come to understand this more fully as we read The Book of Mormon, as you read you'll come to realize that every chapter has a specific purpose that leads back to our Savior. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, concerning The Book of Mormon, that "a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."
    <br>  
    In the final verse, Nephi reassures the reader that he will command his posterity to "not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men." This is shown throughout the rest of the book, the authors after Nephi clearly understand the purpose of the scriptures they write. Jacob the brother of Nephi writes in his account that Nephi gave him a commandment "that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious." Another author in The Book of Mormon, Jarom, understood that "these plates are small... wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little." We can see that the authors in The Book of Mormon took their responsibility very seriously, this is reflected through the contents of their accounts. Sometimes it seems that there is a lesson to be learned and invitation to come unto Christ on every page.
    <br>  
    The purpose of the scriptures is to bring us to the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The scriptures are powerful writings from prophets of ancient instructed by God to write the doctrine of Christ. There is literally no other words on the Earth more important than the words in our scriptures, so we should be attentively seeking out the teachings of them. Strive to seek out the blessings of the scriptures daily
    <br>  
    Prophet Russell M. Nelson promises three things if we study The Book of Mormon daily, he said "I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisions﻿—every day. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life. I promise that as you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day, even the gripping plague of pornography and other mind-numbing addictions." Hearken unto the prophets of today and of acient times in the scriptures and do not miss out on the blessings of the scriptures.

    This week was transfers, and I got moved to... The Boudler Zone! This week has been kind of crazy and stressful, I got a new companion, Elder Rogers and our area is the whole zone since we are spanish missionaries. The change has been wild, in Aurora we had 24 missionaries in the zone, and they had a strong spanish ward, over here theres 12 missionaries in our zone and we only have a small spanish branch, so its been pretty interesting seeing the differences between here and Aurora. Over here theres definitely not as many hispanics, and a lot of them even speak english. Over in Aurora you could find people who speak spanish every where, so its super different being in Boulder.
    <br>  
    Its definitely a bit of a change and Im still getting used to it, Im meeting a ton of new missionaries which is cool. The first 3 days here were kind of rough but its been getting better, yesterday we found 5 people which was awesome! While we were walking a bunch of kids stopped us and asked as what were we doing, we told them we were missionaries and that we had a message about Jesus Christ to share, they let us share the message and told us we could come see their family sometime, which was an awesome miracle we saw.
    <br>  
    Overall its been a good but somewhat stressful week haha

    Hola Amigos!
    <br>  
    I didnt get the chance to send an email last week so I will quickly recap last week.
    <br>  
    Last week one day we woke up and found that our back tire was entirely flat, so we spent and hour changing that haha, we took it to the shop and stopped by Freddys while we were there. Later that day I went on a split with one of my zone leaders and that was super fun.
    <br>  
    I was super sick for like 3 days last week, I lost my voice for a while, it really sucked how I had to stay in bed for a while but I'm okay now. 
    <br>  
    This week was pretty awesome we focused a lot on our baptisms this week and on Saturday we got Christian and Hugo baptized! We found Christian a month back, he was living with Maira Aquino, someone we have been teaching for a while but she just needs to get married to get baptized. We found Christian and taught him pretty quickly and he was ready to follow all the commandments which was awesome! He passed his baptismal interview and it was like 3 mintues long which is crazy! 
    <br>  
    Hugo has been taught for a while, he would always go to church because his girlfriend went, and he didnt really see the point in baptism, although a couple weeks ago he got married and we went and explained the plan of Salvation again and talked about eternal marriage and solved all of his concerns and questions with baptism and we got him to accept a date!
    <br>  
    Both were baptized on Saturday, May 28th and it was an awesome baptism, we were kind of worried not enough people would show up, but then way too many people showed up and we had to get a ton more chairs for the baptism. The talks were awesome and right after the closing prayer, Christian got up and bore his testimony of Christ and Baptism which was awesome!!
    <br>  
    Anyways it was a pretty awesome past two weeks, some of the best so far!
    <br>  
    Love,

    Hey yall,
    <br>
    Bussin week this week it was pretty awesome, we started the week off weekly planning with one of our zone leaders, Elder Connors, he was awesome and gave a ton of insight for our week. That same day we went and put Christian on date for baptism for the 28th, I'm so happy to see him progress and see him at church! On Wednesday we did some service in the middle of the service some car lit on fire and the firemen had to come to put it out, we got some Little Ceasars after that so that was cool. On friday I got to do a split with one of the assistants, he gave a ton of insight to me and we did this awesome English class and gave a church tour to like 15 people afterwards super awesome day. We got Hugo on date for the 28th as well, he comes to church every sunday but he never understood the importance of Baptism so we explained the Plan of Salvation to him and put him on date which was awesome!
    <br>    
    Awesome week overall.
    <br>
    Thought:
    <br>
    "I remembered... the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me... And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more."
    <br>    
    -Alma to his son Helaman(Alma 36:17-19)
    <br>
    Alma chapter 36 is my favorite chapter in the Book of Mormon, I invite all to read and study the message of this chapter. In this chapter Alma is speaking to his son Helaman about his conversion, Alma was one of the vilest sinners but later on became one of the greatest prophets to walk the Earth. Alma speaks of how his "soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins," in that moment of torment he explains how he remembered the words of his father concerning the coming of Christ. When his "mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me." After this Alma explained that he "could remember my pains no more," he beheld "joy" and a "marvelous light," in his words "there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains... that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy." He then "did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God."
    <br>
    This chapter is important because it shows that ANYONE can use the enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to rise from their sins and break the shackles of hell that can torment us. It shows that if we call upon Christ name we will be redeemed no matter who we are. The Book of Ether in the Book of Mormon explains that if we can upon the Lord in our weaknesses humbly that then will he "make weak things become strong unto them." Call upon the Lord, in all things.
    <br>

    This week was kinda crazy, it was pretty normal till Zone Confrence this week, we had Zone Confrence on Thursday and it was awesome learning from other missionaries and our mission president, President Blake is pretty awesome and has a ton of knowledge in his mind. After Zone Confrence President wanted to see me and I thought I was in trouble for a second.😳 He took me in a room and explained that there was a lot of moving around in the mission(some elders going home or getting emergency transferred for some reason) and he felt inspired to move my companion to the Denver Zone, and I thought he was gonna move me out of Aurora but he ended up combining ours and the other spanish elders areas and now we are in a trio! Its been pretty awesome. 
    <br>
    Funny story, after zone Confrence and my meeting with president we went to look for our keys to our car, for context every zone Confrence we have an inspection of our car so we have to leave the key in the car for Elder Walz, at the end of zone Confrence all of the keys for the cars should be on a table, but our key wasnt there so we spent an hour trying to figure out what to do. They ended up just taking our car and we got a ride with other elders. So the day before we got transferred, Friday, we had to walk and take busses which was awful. We got on a bus for an hour and forty minutes and then our person canceled, so rough day.
    <br>
    First day with my new companions i got a baptism(not really haha) but my companions had been teaching a 10 year old named Jonathan and the baptism date was the day I got transferred. His story is pretty awesome, his familie was part of the church a while ago and he fell away, a year ago his dad tried to find the missionaries but those missionaries never reached out. Eventually my companions found his brother talking to one of their investigators and his brother refered him and they got them reactivated in the church and baptized his son this Saturday pretty awesome.
    <br>
    Overall pretty awesome week!
    <br>

    <h1>5/2/2022</h1>
    This week was kinda rough, first thing that happened this week was me throwing up at 3 in the morning, I stayed in bed the whole day Tuesday, it was pretty rough, but surprisingly the next day I woke up fine and ready to do missionary work. We couldn't have a ton of contact with our investigators because they all didn't answer their phones. We met with Alvaro this week, we had him on date for the 23rd of April(obviously didn't happen), he talked to us for an HOUR and 30 MINUTES and we didn't even get to teach him anything, he had questions we went to answer them then in the middle of us answering it he would ask another question. He likes us a lot but we have a hard time teaching him(and contacting him), we tried contacting him a couple weeks ago didn't answer and when we went over he said he lost his phone, so he didn't have a phone for like 2 weeks, last week we visited him(and he had a phone) we got his number and it was cool, this week when we went to visit him he said he lost his phone AGAIN, so we just show up to his house when we need to teach him honestly, its not even worth trying to call haha.
    <br>
    Then we got Elgar who texted us and said he got a new job and he works from Monday to Saturday, Perfect! He can come to church, when Sunday rolled around we asked him if he could come and he said he had to do chores around the house😐. Another person who we can't get into contact with is Martha, Martha was looking really really good for her baptismal date, and then one day she said she couldn't come to our lesson because she was sick and we haven't been able to contact her since. She blocked our phone, blocked the Elders on Facebook who contacted her, and we tried calling on other phones and no answer. We are super bummed about that but we know that the Lord will provide a miracle at some point as long as we keep our faith in Christ.
    <br>
    On a great note Christian came to church, made a ton of friends and seemed to love it, we are going to try to get him baptized, we can't wait to continue to teach him!
    <br>
    The fight against Satan is tough. He has a great grip on our generation but we must triumph over him with our faith in Christ! Jesus loves us! God loves us! The opposition has been strong this week but we will keep pushing foward!

    This week I had an exchange with Elder Anderson, for some context Elder Anderson knows just as much spanish as me. Although we made it work, we struggled but got through lessons and overall it was a pretty awesome day.

    This week, we had transfers, we lost some people like Elder Watts, Elder Franco 😭, Elder Prince, and Elder Palmer(who went home and finished his mission). We got some new people like Elder Bell and Elder Snell, some new zone leaders. Me and Elder Mucha stayed in Aurora, of course.
    <br>
    This week, we got to teach a lot. I led a lesson about commandments with Martha(who showed up to church!). We taught some more powerful lessons. We got to go on a split with Elder Connors, which was really insightful .

    This week was a pretty awesome, we had put two more people on date and had zone Confrence with Elder S. Glifford Nielsen of the first quorum of the seventy, that was awesome he gave us a ton of insight and knowledge. We put Jose on date, hes an awesome dude living with our ward mission leader so he's definitely getting baptized. The other person we put on date is Martha, shes awesome, she speaks english so I actually understood and could contribute to the lesson. Shes super interested and she says shes feels different in our church, she knows that we have the spirit and the truth. They are both set on date for the 14th of May so were helping them prepare.
    <br>
    We got to do service on a ranch this week, we drove like 60 miles out to get there and worked there for a little it was pretty awesome. Other than that its been a good week we got to teach a ton this week and lifes been good.

    ESSAY: The Importance of our Names(Helaman Chapter 5)
    This week, I came across the scripture Helaman 5:6. In this verse Helaman is speaking to his sons Nephi and Lehi, he spoke unto them saying "Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when... ye remember them ye may remember their works." Helaman is refering to Nephi and Lehi, the Lehi who had the vision of the Tree of Life, and the Nephi who was the son of Lehi who retreived the Brass Plates from Laban, and built a boat to travel to the promised land. 
    <br>
    One of the things that have always confused me is the names in the Book of Mormon, theres a lot of duplicate names, there is four Nephis, four Lamans, four Lehis, two Almas and on and on. Question is, why did the people of the Book of Mormon name their sons their own names? That scripture Helaman 5:6 answers that question, the reason why Helaman(and others in the Book of Mormon) name their sons after themselves or their ancestors is to remind them of the greatness and righteousness of those people.
    <br>
    Its important to remember the significance of your name and who you are. In Mosiah Chapter 25, its explained that the descendants of Mulek "were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi."(Verse 26) 
    <br>
    Think of your name, the significance of it, think of others who are great examples and that share your name, Aspire to become them. If no one comes to mind, think of Christ, in 3rd Nephi 27:6 Jesus says "And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day." We can change if we take the name of Christ through baptism, we can change if we remember the name of Chris. In Alma 36, Alma explains that he was "racked with torment" in remembrence of his sins, but when he thought and cried unto Christ saying "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death" he explains that "I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more." Remember and call upon the name of Christ, strive to be like Christ in all things.
    <br>
    Easter is coming remember Christs atonement and resurrection.

    Today has been a shorter week since my last p day was on wednesday. We havent got to teach many people this week, lots of people just cancel on us which sucks. This week was General Confrence though and that was awesome hearing from all the speakers, my two favorite talks were from Elder Bednar and of course President Nelson. Elder Bednar emphasized "heed not to what the wicked may say." This last week I had an interview with my mission president and he told me to be accountable to the Lord, I've been working on not heeding to the words of others but only paying attention to what my God thinks of my efforts.

    This week was pretty awesome, Preparation Day this week was on Wednesday because we had a mission wide temple trip. The temple is right outside our mission area so we can't go to the temple of Preparation Days, but every year we get two temple visits and I was lucky enough to get to go to the temple within my first month in the field.
    <br>
    This week we worked on contacting and getting as many lessons as possible in with people. It was tough but we got in many cool lessons with people.
    <br>
    We taught Ruben the message of the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, he was quite and listened, it seemed to all make sense to him, I gave my testimony in my broken Spanish and we could tell the Spirit of the Lord dwelled in that house at that time. We asked him to read the Book of Mormon and pray about it. I hope that the Holy Ghost will testify to him about the truth of our message. We are going to follow up on it this week.
    <br>
    We also had a great lesson with Eddie who we also taught the message of the Restoration to. He received it well, we asked him if he wanted to get baptized and he said he would think about it, we gave him a Book of Mormon and asked him to pray.
    <br>
    My temple experience today was amazing, I came into the temple with questions and concerns on my mind, everything was taken away when I was in the temple, all of my trials, all of my doubts and concerns, all gone. I have had all my questions answered in someway there. I really soaked it in knowing I wouldn't be back at the temple for a while. I feel at peace, I feel free.
    <br>
    Mosiah 27:25
    And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters
    <br>
    We can all change, God wants us to change, God wants us to give up the things of this world and turn to him. Remove the clutter from our lives and open up your time to our Heavenly Father.

    This week was pretty dope, we did a lot and learned a lot. On wednesday I did an exchange with Elder Bills, that dude is dope, he's 20 months out on the mission and he clearly knows what he's doing. I learned a lot from him on how to be productive and stay on track. We also got to be on a split with my boy Elder Conners, he's one of the zone leaders and he speaks spanish and he's also filled with a ton of knowledge. On Thursday we had a new missionary conference and it was cool, President Blake is a SIGMA MALE BEAST, he's so cool and inspirational, learned a lot there. It's great to soak everything up, there is so much I'm taking in right now it's kind of crazy so it's definitely difficult to focus on my spanish sometimes. We visited quite a few people today and I got to bear my testimony in Spanish. I feel like it's really coming along well, spanish is definitely hard but I'm understanding more day by day.

    We have two people this week who have made great progress in their journey to baptism. We are trying to get Hugo baptized but he says he's not ready yet, but he comes to church every Sunday so our goal is to get him baptized by the end of the transfer. Then there is Hermana(Sister) Aquino, we visited her last night and shared a short message and she expressed that she wanted to get baptized so we set her on a date for the 9th of April. There are some complications with it that we need to work out but she's definitely getting baptized which is awesome.
    <br>
    Me and Elder Mucha have had some crazy moments driving, I have minimal experience with driving and the drivers in Colorado are definitely not helping. I've seen at least 2 cop cars everyday here and some pretty weird things but it's cool over here. I'm loving it though its really awesome to be here and everyday is the best day ever.
    <br>
    REMEMBER TO SAY YOUR PRAYS AND COMMUNICATE WITH GOD, HE WANTS YOU TO TALK TO HIM AND GIVE YOU BLESSING DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    It's pretty cool being on the field, l left the 9th and arrived in the afternoon, I was the last one to arrive to the airport and there was like 15 other missionaries waiting for me. I was the Spanish speaking missionary besides one other sister that came from the Mexico mtc. We slept at the Marriott and then the next day we met our trainers.
    <br>
    My trainer is Elder Mucha and he's dope, he speaks fluent Spanish and English so I was in luck. We spent the first couple days trying to contact a lot of people, lots of lessons fell through but we got to give two people messages and it was great. I got to share my testimony in Spanish with them and for the most part I think they understood. The only problem I'm having right now is definitely just listening and understanding the people it's hard but I see myself improving each day.
    <br>
    I met some great Elders, Elder Franco is a beast, he lives next to me and Elder Mucha and we have meals together and it's epic.
    <br>
    Much Love guys trust the Lord, read your Scriptures, they are from God and need to be studied each and everyday of our lives.

    ¡Hola!
    <br>
    This was the final week of the MTC/CCM. It's kind of sad saying goodbye to the people I’ve met in these very short six weeks. I have learned a lot from my teachers and district. I do really wish I could have met all of them in person because they are some of the coolest people I’ve ever met and they were all very motivated. I hate when people scold me about not getting the vaccine and missing the opportunity to go to the MTC in person, some of those negative thoughts live in the back of my head. Not many people one saw the vision, not many people saw the positives, but these past 6 weeks have been nothing but positive because of the opportunity of meeting other people that didn’t have the vaccine and had to stay home as well(even if it was through zoom). I have been blessed to meet these great people and I have been able to open up to them more than most of the people I've met because their intentions were pure and they were genuine, relatable people.
    <br>
    I am nervous about the coming week and heading out to Denver alone, but the one thing I have been focused on is confidence, if I have confidence in the Lord, and if the Lord has confidence in me, then I will have the power to take a leap of faith and put myself in his work confidently. KEEP YOUR FAITH IN GOD, AND HE WILL KEEP HIS FAITH IN YOU! I feel blessed to head over and teach the great people of Denver Colorado!

    This week has been great, lots of learning and growing experiences this week but nothing too crazy. I got to attend the temple this week with my friends Rodney and Aana, it was Rodney's first time going through the endowment session so it was great being there with him. To me the temple is the bridge from our world to heaven, when I'm in the temple time seems to stop and the only feelings I have are positive joyful feelings.

    OPEN OUR EYES
    <br>
    This week I read in John chapter 8. In chapter 8 Jesus Christ heals the blind man, we often use this chapter to explain service and why it is important, but I have always feeled somewhat disconnected from this story in a sense. To heal someone of their blindness in seconds is an impossible miracle only Christ could perform, how could I ever do something as amazing as that? I decided to look at the story in a different perspective, in the  perspective of our day and age, I likened the world and Jesus Christ to missionaries. People are blinded by their lusts, addictions, and desires to the things of the world, people are blind and do not know the truth of Jesus Christ. Missionaries are like Jesus Christ in that they go into the world to heal people of their blindness to the truth, instead of physically opening peoples eyes, missionaries are metaphorically opening the peoples eyes to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What I find interesting in this story, is that after Jesus Christ healed the blind men people did not believe that Christ healed him of his blindness. When we awake and open our eyes to see the truth, people will doubt and won't believe us. Another important thing to point out is that the blind man was healed according to his faith, people are waiting for messengers of God to come and heal their blindness, to preach the truth unto them. HARDEN NOT YOUR HEARTS AND YOU WILL BE HEALED OF YOUR BLINDNESS.

    ¡Hola!
    <br>
    I have just two more weeks in the MTC, and then I will be flying out to Denver Colorado and living there to preach and teach and speak about our Almighty Heavenly Father. I feel disadvantaged in a way because usually missionaries get to go to the MTC in person and get used to living alone for a little bit in a somewhat comfortable place with a predictable lifestyle, but this will be the first time I’ll be spending more than a week away from my home, I have literally zero knowledge of what I’ll be doing on March 9th and so forth. I may be nervous but I am will lead myself with confidence in myself and in the Lord, GOD WILL LET THE BLESSING POUR DOWN ON OUR MISSIONARY WORK.
    <br>
    This week I got the opportunity to reflect why I’m here and think about just one thing I wanted to do whilst on my mission. I simply want to change someone’s life. If I change one life, I’ll change a families entire existence from now on till Jesus Christ comes again. The people that converted my ancestors have changed my entire existence in this life, if my ancestors never joined the church I would haven’t been the person I am today, my drive and motivation comes from Heavenly Father and having the faith and knowledge that Jesus Christ lives and that he will come again. CHANGING PEOPLES LIVES WILL CHANGE THE WORLD.
    <br>
    D&C 18:15-16
    <br>
    15 And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!
    <br>
    16 And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!
    <br>
    Jesus Christ gave it all, I believe that, so I feel responsible to share that message with everyone I can, Amen.
    <br>
    I FEEL KINDA FREEEE

    ¡Hola!
    <br>
    I felt more comfortable with myself this week, I refuse to keep my focus on my mistakes, instead I focus on the future and improvement. This week has gone by very quickly but I’ve seen the improvement, last week I felt like I didn’t really know how to put sentences together, now as long as I know the words I can speak my thoughts on a basic level. I just feel like I need more practice and to learn new words. I am trying to really put myself out there and try to speak Spanish even when I feel like I don’t know the words.
    <br>
    My district has been doing great they are all Alpha males(and female) and its been great talking and learning with them this week. Just a great week overall.
    <br>
    Spiritual Thoughts:
    <br>
    1st Nephi 22:22 “And the righteous need not fear” When God is on your side youll have nothing to fear. Remember to act according to faith and not according to the world. Nephi shows a great example of this, throughout 1st Nephi he trusted in God and feared none
    <br>
    Not much to write about this week but I just want to let everyone know I’m doing fine, the MTC is hard but I haven’t given up and I never will.

    ¡Hola!
    <br>
    It has been a full two weeks in the MTC, this week has honestly been a lot harder than the first. It went by a whole lot quicker and I feel as though I haven’t been as focused as I should be, I have grown a lot closer to my district and companions this week and we have practiced and learned a whole ton this week. I feel like the hardest thing this week was just improving in Spanish, I have felt doubts this week, but every where I look in the scriptures seems to be a reminder of the purpose and power of my mission. Mosiah 15:28, “And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.” I realize that I am one of those chosen to preach the gospel in Spanish, God knows me and he will deliver me.
    <br>
    I have formed a much greater study plan to start learning at a more rapid pace, I have realized that I’m not trying to obtain fluency, I am just trying to get to a point where I can speak and listen to people and express my thoughts about the Gospel. I am going to focus a lot more on that idea of learning a language.
    <br>
    Today I have rearranged my bedroom to create a more open feeling, simplistic environment that will keep me focused on the work at hand. I went to Costco and I saw another Elder who was at Home MTC and he was heading out to Bolivia on his mission, so that was pretty cool. I feel a whole lot more focused, so I’m very optimistic about this upcoming week.
    <br>
    Spiritual Thoughts:
    <br>
    Mosiah 5:15, “Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.” Keep yourself and your testimony in a state of steadfastness and immovability no matter what, doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.

    ¡Hola!
    <br>
    I've been a missionary for almost a whole week now! It's been very difficult but extremely rewarding. The Spirit of God has dwelled within my soul ever since I was set apart as a missionary. 
    <br>
    My Spanish is coming along, I'm having trouble with it, and it's extremely daunting but I know I'm going to be able to learn Spanish as long as I keep the faith I have in God. I have seen great progress I've made in such a little bit of time.
    <br>
    My district is full of awesome people, our district only has 5 missionary whilst others have 10 or more, we have a lot less since everyone in my district including me will be online learning the whole duration of the MTC. My companions, Elder Anderson and Hermana Dababneh are great! I have two companions because the Sister in our district is the only one there, so they put her with me and Elder Anderson. The rest of my district consists of Elder Jenson and Elder Sargent both great guys. Even though my situation is a bit unique I feel blessed to be put with these missionaries, and I seen the vision God has for us.
    <br>
    It's amazing to be an environment where everyday I am with motivated positive people that all have the Spirit with them, I was a bit apprehensive about learning Spanish entirely online at the MTC but after my first class at the MTC I knew that I was at the right place and I felt the Spirit testify to me that I will be able to learn Spanish throughout the next six weeks. I’ve been busy and productive this entire week learning Spanish and embracing the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ, I felt the spirit throughout this entire week leading me and guiding me through this difficult but important experience. I feel free. It is great to move away from the worldly things and serve God with all your heart. I feel free.
    <br>
    Spiritual Thoughts:
    <br>
    I invite everyone to study the Book of Mormon, in 1st Nephi 6:6 it says "Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men." Everything written in the Book of Mormon has a purpose and worth to it, I know that if you study the Book of Mormon you will find answers to your questions that you have in your life!
    <br>
    Remember that you can do all with God by your side, in Isaiah 41:10 it states "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness." I know that as long as I stay righteous God will deliver me and grant me the Gift of Tongues to learn Spanish in a fast and efficient way so that I can bring souls unto Christ. You can do the same in your situation, whatever you're struggling with call unto God in righteousness, and he will help you.
    <br>
    Christ loves and understands us perfectly, channel that love and positively and live your life like Christ did loving one another. Moses 7:33, "And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood;"
